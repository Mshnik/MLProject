\section{Team}
This project will be completed by a team of 4 students.

\section{Motivation}
DonorsChoose is a crowd funding website that helps public school teachers request and receive funding. 70 percent of campaigns on DonorsChoose are successfully funded. While this is a healthy margin, it could be vastly improved. It would be valuable for teachers to learn what factors may affect the success of their campaign.  

Extensive research about Kickstarter and other similar crowd-funding sources has already been done to investigate causes of successful commercial campaigns. It would be interesting to compare and contrast factors that influence the successful of a crowd-funding campaign in the commercial realm versus in the philanthropic realm.

\section{Problem Statement}
The main goal of this project is to determine what factors have the greatest influence on if a project will be fully funded.  in particular, we are interested in investigating whether characteristics of a project such as the location of the school, the poverty level, the grade level, or area of study (such as english versus chemistry) affect the likelihood of funding.  

We are also interested in looking at how characteristics of already pledged donations affect likelihood of future donations, and thus success of projects in a time-series framework.

DonorChoose enables various promotions such as having a corporation match donations.  We would like to investigate if these promotions affect the number or size of donation as well as if they affect the likelihood of a project being funded.

The dataset also includes project description essays, written by the creating teachers. We'd like to use some existing software to extract important keywords and add these as feature vectors for our linear classifier.
\section{Approach}

We are trying to find a linear classifier that describes what a successful project entails, highlight which "features" are most important, and try to understand the effect of "momentum" in terms of donations.  We plan to use existing software to find a linear classifier (like SVM light) and will experiment with different scaling of our data as well as omitting certain fields to achieve the best outcome.  As for identifying the most important features we will look at the weighting of the feature vectors in the optimal hyperplane as well as run some model selection tests where we omit certain features and observe the change in accuracy on our test set.  In order to evaluate the effect of "momentum" we will try adding this data in during different parts of the funding process to see if SVM light can find a connection as well as model the correlation between amount and date of funding and the ultimate success of the project. 

\section{Resources}
We will use existing linear classification software provided publicly online, starting with SVM light and expanding to other software as necessary. File reading and other custom code written for this project is written in Scala, a publicly accessible and OS-agnostic language. The full dataset for this project is provided publicly by Kaggle. It is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data.
